Analysis of 1BR apartments in Chicago

## When to start renting in Chicago?
This is a brief walkthrough of EDA and how you do not have to go through fancy algorithms to gain big insights.

Long story short, it's best to look for an apartment around November.

We look at the average median monthly rentals for 1 bedroom apartments in popular Chicago neighborhoods across the years. I was first inspired to dive into this, because I am new to Chicago and had heard that renting a place later in the year would be more cost-effective. However, I wanted to know by how much.

## Effects and Causes
There is on average, a 10% difference in price from high-peak to low-peak season. That means, in some neighborhoods, you could be spending an extra $3,000 a year just based on the time you decided to rent.

Now, several causes of this seasonality of renters can be attributed to the physical seasonality. By November, winter is coming around and not many people are wanting to be out in the cold moving in to a new place. Another attributing factor can be because of the seasonality of schools. College students are in transition between school years and will tend to be looking for places in July and August.

## Assumptions
We assume that there are the same number of available options across each month.

We assume the same quality of property across the board. Higher-value properties may be taken out of the market sooner.
